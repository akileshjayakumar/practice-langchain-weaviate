# LangChain and Weaviate Practice

This repository allows me to practice and learn how to use LangChain and Weaviate to build and implement language models.

## Acknowledgement

For detailed documentation and practice, I will be referencing and using the official LangChain and Weaviate integration guide available at [LangChain Weaviate Integration](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate/).
