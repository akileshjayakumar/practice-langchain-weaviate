# LangChain and Weaviate Practice

This repository is for me to practice and learn how to use LangChain and Weaviate together to build and implement language models.

## Acknowledgement
This practice is guided by various resources and documentation from the LangChain and Weaviate communities.

## References
For detailed documentation and practice, I will be referencing and using the official LangChain and Weaviate integration guide available at [LangChain Weaviate Integration](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate/).
